# Caffeine

This small tool helps **keep your PC awake**. It simply **presses and releases the Left Shift key every minute**, as long as there **hasn't been any keyboard or mouse activity**.

Though it might seem pointless, it can be quite useful in certain situations. For example, imagine you're discussing a slide in your presentation that requires a detailed explanation. This discussion could last longer than the time it takes for your screensaver to kick in, interrupting your talk with a lock screen at the most crucial moment. Sure, you could disable the screensaver or extend its timer, but sometimes, security settings prevent you from making these changes. That's where my tool, Caffeine, comes in handy. It keeps your screen active allowing you to concentrate on your presentation topic instead of worrying about the screensaver.

## Security Note

Caffeine is straightforward and safe, as you can see from its source code. However, using it carelessly might leave your PC unlocked when it should be secure. Please use it responsibly and only when you truly need it. Remember to exit Caffeine once it's no longer needed.

## Installation

Caffeine doesn't need to be installed. It's fully portable and doesn't save any settings in folders or the registry. To use it, simply **download the zip file from the Releases section and unpack it** into any folder where you have an access. 

## Usage

Caffeine is a regular .exe application. Once you start it, a **new icon will appear in your system tray**. A **red checkmark indicates the tool is active** and keeping your PC awake. When Caffeine is 'pressing' Left Shift (to emulate your presence) the checkmark in the system tray is shortly blinking indicating that it's working.

Double-clicking this icon temporarily turns off Caffeine, allowing your screensaver to function as usual. **When Caffeine is off, a red cross appears to show it's disabled**. To reactivate Caffeine, **either double-click the icon** again or select the **"Caffeine Enabled" option from the menu** that appears when you **right-click the application icon in the system tray**. This gives your PC a fresh dose of Caffeine.
